# ServiceManager 

### Context:
My family has owned and operated walk-in Dry Cleaning businesses within the Seattle area for almost three 
decades. At a very young age I've been around the cleaning plant, observing the entire cleaning process 
from beginning to end. In-fact I have worked at the plant off and on since high school and help to this day.

### The problem:
I have observed the invoicing system go from carbon-less paper to a digital system, and yet I still notice 
production issues where some items are not ready or missing at the projected completion day and time. 

The worst case 
scenario is when the entire process misses this fact and allows the customer to pick up their items instead 
of notifying the customer that the items are not ready for pickup. This reflects poorly on the business and 
most importantly inconvenient to the customer who now needs to make several trips or modify their itinerary.

Fundamentally, the current digital invoicing system is no different from the previous carbon-less paper
invoicing system as it requires individuals to manually ensure that the serviced items are all accounted 
for. This is problematic as this process relies on an individuals' memory to complete the auxiliary tasks 
where an individual may have to process up to 60 invoices a day while having several responsibilities on a 
given day.

### The Solution:
I propose a digital invoicing system that incorporates this check. Instead of an invoice be a passive record 
of items within a database. I propose that an invoice to have an active realtime tracking of the completion 
of the items within a given invoice using hardware such as a barcode scanner. A realtime tracker of invoices 
due for the day can also be displayed for auxiliary tasks. I will also be implementing an Invoicing System.
