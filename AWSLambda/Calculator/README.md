##Calculator Overview
Calculator is an application that performs simple operations on BigDecimal Scalars, 2D Vectors, and Complex 
Numbers via AWS Lambda. The Object-Oriented approach segments objects into Values, Operators, Expressions, 
and Equations. The number of arguments used in instantiating a Value object determines whether the Operand 
is a Scalar, a 2D Vector, or a Complex Number. 

### Objectives:
    - Implement a servicable AWS Lambda function
    - Use Object Oriented design to implement a Calculator

### Conclusion:
The Calculator App works as designed however
